  summary: Login to a user account
  description: |
    The following intructions assume that you already [created a user account](https://inventaire.io/signup), and thus already have a username and password.

    There are currently two ways to make authenfied requests:
      * using [BasicAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), passing your username and password with each requests [**slow**]
      * getting session cookies and passing them with each requests [**fast**]

    The login endpoint is about getting those session cookies, namely `express:sess` and `express:sess.sig`.

    In the future, inventaire.io could also allow to authentify requests using OAuth, please upvote and/or comment [this issue](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/issues/84) if you're interested
